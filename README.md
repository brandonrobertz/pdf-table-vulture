# PDF Table Vulture

Extract tables, figures, and other structured data from PDF. Works where things like tabula, etc, don't. That means in cases where you don't have perfect tables.

Highly configurable. Not so easy to use, right now. But the goal here is to build a total Swiss Army Knife for PDF data extraction. This is being built to extract messy multi-page spanning tables from pentagon FOIA'd PDFs. Story and data coming soon.
